DESeq2 is a powerful tool commonly used for the analysis of RNA-seq data, particularly in identifying differentially expressed genes between conditions or treatments. It employs a negative binomial distribution to model read counts and provides statistical methods to assess differential expression with robustness against various sources of variation. DESeq2's workflow typically involves steps such as data normalization, estimation of dispersion, and statistical testing, enabling researchers to pinpoint genes significantly altered under different experimental conditions.
